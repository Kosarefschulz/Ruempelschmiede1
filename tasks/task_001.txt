# Title: Project Setup with Next.js 14 App Router
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project with Next.js 14 using the App Router architecture, configure essential dependencies, and set up the project structure.
# Details:
1. Create a new Next.js 14 project using `npx create-next-app@latest` with TypeScript
2. Configure the app directory structure following App Router conventions
3. Set up essential dependencies: tailwindcss, eslint, prettier
4. Configure environment variables (.env.local, .env.example)
5. Set up basic layout components (RootLayout, Header, Footer)
6. Initialize Git repository with appropriate .gitignore
7. Configure basic SEO metadata handling with next/head
8. Set up image optimization with next/image
9. Create a component library structure for reusable UI elements

# Test Strategy:
Verify project builds successfully with `npm run build`. Ensure all pages render without errors in development mode. Test navigation between routes. Validate that the project structure follows Next.js 14 App Router conventions.
